IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU DONT CHANGE THE IMAGE SIZE
UNLESS YOU MAKE IMAGES WITH A DIFFERENT IMAGE SIZE THAN 97x43PX
put any 97x43px image in the DVD_Logos folder for it to be used

in the DEFAULTS.txt file you can change the default:
window width, window height
picture width, picture height

In the top right are ADD, and TOTAL
ADD: tells you how many logos to add when left or right click, 
also removes that many when middle clicked
TOTAL: total number of logos on the screen

Featureless.py is not necessarily meant to be readable, it's more of a challenge for me to get it in the least amount of lines of code as possible
    don't ask why, I just want to
